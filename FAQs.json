  "question": "how does google power its data centers",
  "answer": "Our goal is to use as much renewable energy as possible to power our data centers. But the places with the best clean power potential are not typically the same places where a data center can best serve its users (for example, they may not be particularly sunny or windy). So we found a creative solution: we locate our data centers where they can be most efficient, and we often buy renewable energy from where it’s most efficiently produced. Moreover, we've committed more than $1 billion to renewable energy projects to grow this industry as a whole.\nbuy renewable energy",

  "question": "what minimum gpa and test scores do i need to be admitted",
  "answer": "We don't have a minimum GPA. We don't have a minimum SAT score.\nAs strange as these answers sound, they're both true. A cumulative GPA only reveals so much; it says little about the difficulty of a student's course load, or whether a student's grades have improved over time, or the level of grade inflation (or deflation) in a student's school. If we established a firm minimum GPA, a point below which no applicant would have any chance of being admitted, we'd miss a fair number of students who might make UVA a better, stronger place.\nThe same is true for SAT scores. Most people who work in admission at highly selective universities believe that standardized testing is a useful but imprecise instrument. Setting an absolute minimum would be asking these tests to do something they weren't designed to do.\nOf course, our applicant pool is broad and deep, so most admitted students have excelled in school and scored well on the SAT or ACT (see our Profile for more information).

UAA works with academic advisors in each of VCU’s colleges and schools to ensure a successful transition for all first-year students moving into academic advising by major.\nacademic advising by major",
